# net-check
Linux Network Option, check and setting script, for optimum network performance.

# Overview
The script's goal is to provide an easy to use tool that covers each possible option with a vaild set of choices or valid reason for changing each property.

Each kernel option has been thouroughly read up on, and resources listed out. I've learnt alot during the process of writing this scirpt, one key thing I've taken away is just how much value a newer kernel brings to networking.

## Further Developments
Over the next couple of weeks i'll be feeding in items from feedback, along with the following items.

* Better bandwidth calculation algorithms, for an overview.
* Improvements on the congestion tests in the scirpt already.
* Setup variable input for the "HTB" queue discipline setup (for older kernels).

### Feedback
I'm very keen to hear feedback on the script, from anyone, technical or not. Please don't be shy to get in contact.
